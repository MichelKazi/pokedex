# Pokedex project

I took the time to teach myself React as I went through this project.

## ToDo

- Make it so in order to catch a pokemon, your equipped pokemon needs to deal some damage to it and get its hp under 50%

## Current issues
- You can't have two of the same Pokemon. Not the biggest deal in the world
- Not everyone has a 4k monitor so it's gonna get ugly
