## Here's my really ambitious fucking idea

I wanna make an app in React, that shows the user a map
The map will be based on the user's location

The map will have pokemon sprites painted throughout the map
Oh and the map will be dark bc the default googlemaps is ugly imo


sprites will have a minimum radius distance from each other
sprites will also have a maximum radius distance

sprites are clickable, they'll display the pokemon's info when you click em
You can then add that pokemon to your Trainer's team, but you only have a limit of 5


Randomize pokemon:
    initialize 50-100 pokemon in initial map location
    use math.random within a range
    Math.floor(Math.random() * however many there are) + 1 //to pass as an ID for the randomly generated pokemon
